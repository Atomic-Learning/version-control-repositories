<p>In version control systems, a repository (or "repo") is a set of files and folders which collectively represent a project. This includes all of the project's code, as well as its history of changes. A repository may also be used to store metadata, documentation, and other related files. Depending on the particular version control system, repositories may be stored locally on a developer's machine or remotely on a server. It is common for different developers to have their own local copies of the repository, allowing them to work on the project independently before sharing their changes with others.</p>

<p>The fact that repositories store the history of changes is crucial for collaboration. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with each other's work. Each developer can make changes in their own local copy of the repository, and then merge those changes back into the main project when they are ready. This process helps to ensure that the project remains stable and that all changes are tracked and documented. It also allows a developer to experiment with new ideas without affecting the main codebase, or to revert back to a previous state if something goes wrong.</p>
